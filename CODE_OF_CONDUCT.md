## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside the project spaces when that behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the project's security email address or through the project's issue tracker with appropriate labels. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Reports should include:

- Contact information of the reporter (so we can get in touch if we need more information)
- Names and contact information of any witnesses
- A clear description of what happened
- When and where the incident occurred
- The impact of the behavior on you and others
- Any additional context that would be helpful
- Whether this is an ongoing issue
- Any other relevant information

We are committed to providing a safe reporting mechanism. Reports can be made anonymously if preferred, though this may limit our ability to fully investigate the matter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeal Process

If you believe a moderation decision was made in error, you may appeal the decision by contacting the project maintainers. Appeals will be reviewed by a different set of community leaders than those who made the original decision, when possible. The appeal process should be initiated within 30 days of the original decision.

Appeals should include:
- A clear explanation of why you believe the decision was incorrect
- Any new information that was not available during the original review
- A commitment to follow the Code of Conduct going forward
- Any other relevant information
